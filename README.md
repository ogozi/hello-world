# hello-world

First repository on Github, feeling like a geek already:)

Its an exciting day, after weeks of anticipation, I opened my email to find my invitation to OpenCon 2018 Toronto, Canada. This is my second invitation in two years, I couldn't make it to OpenCon 2017 because of lack of funding but I'm seriously hoping to get the needing funds this year so I can have the opportunity of connecting with like minds to help kickstart my projects, one of which is Malabosquare.com.

This project involves creating a website that provides daily news and updates about happenings in and around the University of Calabar campus, where I currently study. There has always been an information gap, as the school's website offers very little in this aspect and there are no reliable alternatives. Malaborsquare.com will be the go-to platftorm for students and non-students to access the latest information about the university.

The website will also include and open online repository for academic materials, to aid studies and exchange of ideas.

Really hoping I can get the needed resource to pull this off. Starting with my participation in OpenCon 2018.
